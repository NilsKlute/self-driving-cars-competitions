# Self-Driving Cars — Competition Submissions (WS 2025/26)

Agents submitted to the three course-wide challenges of **Self-Driving Cars** (9 ECTS, Winter 2025/26),
taught by Prof. Dr. Andreas Geiger at the
[Autonomous Vision Group](https://www.cvlibs.net/), University of Tübingen.
[→ Official course page](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/lectures/self-driving-cars/)

**Team "The Imitation Game"** — Nils Klute, Frieder Wizgall

All three challenges use the same task: drive `CarRacing-v2` (Gymnasium) from raw `96×96×3` RGB
observations. The leaderboard score is the mean reward over 10 held-out track seeds, 600 steps per
episode, with per-episode rewards clipped at zero. The evaluation seeds are not published, so no
result below is tuned on the tracks it was scored on.

## Results

| Challenge | Approach | Leaderboard score | Placement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Imitation Learning | Behavioural cloning, CNN action classifier | 741.3 | **2nd** |
| Reinforcement Learning | Dueling Double DQN (n-step, NoisyNet) | 605.0 | — |
| Modular Pipeline | Lane detection → waypoints → Stanley + PID | 766.8 | **2nd** |
| **Total** | | **2,113.0** | 5th of 33 teams |

Scores on the local (public-seed) evaluation, for reference: 809.6 imitation learning,
768.1 modular pipeline.

The exercise skeletons (`sdc_wrapper.py`, the scoring functions, the DQN training loop scaffold)
are provided by the course; everything marked `TODO` in the handout — network architectures, data
pipeline, Q-learning step, replay buffer, and all four pipeline modules — is our work.

## 1. Imitation Learning

Behavioural cloning on self-recorded expert demonstrations. Continuous expert actions are
discretised into **9 action classes** (steer left/right × {gas, brake, neutral}, plus pure gas, brake and idle),
turning control into single-frame classification.

**Network** ([network.py](Imitation%20Learning/network.py)) — three `3×3` conv blocks
(8 → 16 → 32 channels, LeakyReLU 0.2, dropout 0.2), each followed by `2×2` max pooling, then
`12·12·32 → 1024 → 9`. Deliberately small, as larger networks run the risk of overfitting the demonstration
set.

**Data & training** ([data.py](Imitation%20Learning/data.py), [training.py](Imitation%20Learning/training.py))

- ~680k recorded demonstration frames for the main run; 90/10 train/val split. 
  The submitted agent is fine-tuned at a lower learning
  rate on a curated high-quality subset (collected with lower fps sim rate and greater care).
- Augmentation: horizontal flip with corresponding sign-inverted steering plus brightness jitter.
- Adam (`lr=1e-4`), cross-entropy, `StepLR(step=40, γ=0.5)`, mixed precision, early stopping on
  validation loss (patience 10 epochs).

**Two key tricks worth mentioning**

- The idle action class is mapped onto gas at inference time. The reason: The recorded data contains many
  frames with no keys pressed; so the agent may easily stall at the start of an episode never being able to score
- Throttle is emitted at a constant 0.45 rather than the recorded value, which keeps the car below
  the speed at which the policy drifts off uncontrollably with insufficient capabilities to recover.

Intermediate checkpoints are kept in
[subobtimal_agents/](Imitation%20Learning/subobtimal_agents/), our final agent is the top-level [agent.pth](Imitation%20Learning/agent.pth).

 **Limitations**
 - Amount of collected data due to time constraints. We did not see clear saturation with increasing data,
   so recording even more expert demonstrations would have been the next natural step. 
 - Pure Behavioral Cloning. No consequences of the policy actions are present 
   in the data. A data aggregation approach could migitate this problem.

```bash
cd "Imitation Learning"
python main.py --collect --training_data_path data   # record demonstrations (arrow keys, TAB saves)
python main.py --train   --training_data_path data_HQ --agent_save_path agent.pth
python main.py --test    --agent_load_path agent.pth # watch 5 episodes
python main.py --score   --agent_load_path agent.pth # public-seed leaderboard score
```

## 2. Reinforcement Learning

Deep Q-learning over a discrete action set, trained from scratch on pixels
([model.py](Reinforcement%20Learning/model.py), [learning.py](Reinforcement%20Learning/learning.py),
[deepq.py](Reinforcement%20Learning/deepq.py)).

Extensions over the vanilla DQN baseline:

- **Dueling head** — shared features split into state value and advantage streams, recombined as
  `Q = V + (A − mean A)`.
- **Double Q-learning** — action selection by the policy net, evaluation by the target net.
- **n-step returns** (n = 3) accumulated inside the replay buffer.
- **NoisyNet** — factorised Gaussian noisy linear layers (Fortunato et al.) as a learned alternative
  to ε-greedy; with noise enabled the policy acts greedily and explores through its own parameters.
  σ statistics are logged during training to confirm exploration actually decays.
- **Sensor input** — speed, four ABS readings, steering and gyroscope are decoded from the HUD pixel
  rows and concatenated onto the flattened conv features, so the Q-network sees velocity explicitly
  instead of having to infer it from a single frame.

Configuration: 200k-transition replay buffer, learning starts at 10k steps, target update every 750
steps, action repeat 4, Adam (`lr=1e-4`, `eps=1.5e-4`), gradient clipping. Training runs headless on
the compute cluster; `safe_step` guards against the environment occasionally hanging on `env.step`
during long unattended runs, which otherwise cost whole jobs.

 **Limitations**
 - Small discrete action set (left, right, full gas, full brake). Without graded braking or
   combined steer-and-brake actions the agent can't brake smoothly into corners; a richer action set
   or a continuous-action method would be the next step.
 - Uniform replay sampling. Rare but informative transitions, such as recovering after leaving the
   track, are seen as often as routine straight driving; prioritized experience replay would
   complete the Rainbow-style extensions above.

```bash
cd "Reinforcement Learning"
python train_racing.py --total_timesteps 1000000 --use_doubleqlearning --noisy --no_display \
                       --action_filename default_actions.txt --agent_name agent --outdir models
python evaluate_racing.py --agent_name agent --action_filename default_actions.txt
```

## 3. Modular Pipeline

A classical perception-and-control stack, no learned components.

**Lane detection** ([lane_detection.py](Modular%20Pipeline/lane_detection.py)) — the road surface is
isolated by an RGB range mask, the image is cropped at the car's front (row 63) and flipped so that
row 0 is nearest the vehicle. Absolute gradients are thresholded, row-wise local maxima are found
with `find_peaks`, and edge points are greedily assigned to the two boundaries by nearest neighbour
(rejecting jumps ≥ 40 px). Each boundary is fitted with a smoothed B-spline; if a frame yields too
few points, the previous frame's splines are reused.

**Waypoints** ([waypoint_prediction.py](Modular%20Pipeline/waypoint_prediction.py)) — six centre points
between the two boundary splines, then refined by minimising
`MSE(centre) − 40 · curvature`, which cuts corners instead of tracking the centre line exactly.
Target speed falls off exponentially with path curvature (`max 95`, `offset 30`, `exp const 6.5`):
near-full throttle on straights, early lift into bends.

**Control** — Stanley lateral controller ([lateral_control.py](Modular%20Pipeline/lateral_control.py))
combining heading error and cross-track error, with a damping term against the previous steering
angle and clipping at ±0.4; PD longitudinal controller
([longitudinal_control.py](Modular%20Pipeline/longitudinal_control.py), `KP = KD = 0.01`, integral term
disabled) translating the control signal into gas or brake.

During the first 30 frames the environment zooms in on the car and lane detection is unreliable, so
the pipeline commands a straight-ahead path instead of steering on noise. The controller gains and
speed profile were tuned jointly — the tuning trace, including the runs that led to the submitted
768 configuration, is in [hyperparameter.txt](Modular%20Pipeline/hyperparameter.txt).


 **Limitations**
 - Parameters were tuned by hand against the public evaluation seeds, so part of the late gains
   may not carry over to unseen tracks; tuning on a fixed set of separate seeds, with a final
   check on a held-out set, would be the next step.



```bash
cd "Modular Pipeline"
python modular_pipeline.py                     # 5 episodes, rendered
python modular_pipeline.py --score --no_display  # public-seed leaderboard score
python test_lane_detection.py                  # per-module visual checks
```

## Setup

Python 3.10+ with PyTorch (CUDA optional but assumed for training), Gymnasium with the Box2D extra,
NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pygame (demonstration recording only).

```bash
pip install torch torchvision "gymnasium[box2d]" numpy scipy matplotlib pygame
```

`sdc_wrapper.py` (identical in all three folders) zeroes the on-screen score, clips reward at −0.1,
and optionally exposes the true speed via `info['speed']` — the modular pipeline uses that,
the learned agents do not.

The imitation-learning demonstrations ship as [data_HQ.zip](Imitation%20Learning/data_HQ.zip)
(95 MB compressed, 1.7 GB unpacked). Unzip it inside `Imitation Learning/` — it expands to
`data_HQ/{observations.npy, actions.npy}` — and pass `--training_data_path data_HQ`.
